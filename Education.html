  <h3>Education</h3>
  <ul>
    <a href="https://www.pvusd.net">
      <li>Pajaro Valley High School</li>
    </a>
    <ul>
      <li>This school has a prison-like feel and is separated into two halves. Students are also separated into two lunches so they may never get to see their friends during breaks.</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="https://www.artinstitutes.edu/">
      <li>Art Institute of Silicon Valley</li>
    </a>
    <ul>
      <li>This school was shut down months after I stopped attending, as it was apparently known for scamming students into paying tons of money, only for the school to pretend you don't exist shortly after receiving your money.</li>
